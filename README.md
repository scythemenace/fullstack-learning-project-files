# Full Stack Learning Projects

Welcome to my full stack learning repository! This repository is a collection of mini-projects, experiments, and assignments that I have completed while learning web application development using the MERN stack. It serves as both a personal learning journal and a resource for others interested in similar topics. Note:- Currently I am exploring the MERN stack due to its flexibility and ease of use for personal projects, but will be diving into other relevant technologies like Laravel(PHP), Golang-HTMX, etc.

## About the Repository

This repository contains multiple folders, each representing a week of learning or a specific topic within the MERN stack. Some folders contain assignments or questions that I have solved, while others are experimental projects where I applied new concepts learned during that week. The repository is a work in progress and will continue to grow as I advance in my learning journey.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **React**
- **Recoil**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Axios**
- **JWT Authentication**

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 2

**Topics Covered:**

- Asynchronous nature of JavaScript
- Promises and their usage

**Description:**

Explored the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, focusing on how promises work and how they can be used to handle asynchronous operations effectively.

### Week 3

**Topics Covered:**

- Express.js
- MongoDB integration
- JWT Authentication

**Description:**

Experimented with building server-side applications using Express.js and MongoDB. Implemented JWT authentication for securing APIs and completed multiple assignments related to these technologies.

### Week 4

**Topics Covered:**

- DOM Fundamentals
- Introduction to React
- Understanding Reconcilers

**Description:**

Learned about the Document Object Model (DOM) and why React was developed to address its limitations. Studied how React's reconcilers work under the hood to efficiently update the UI.

### Week 5

**Topics Covered:**

- Basic React Projects
- Counter App
- Todo App

**Description:**

Built basic mini-projects using React to get comfortable with its syntax and component-based architecture. Developed a simple counter app and started working on a todo app. The full todo app is available in a separate repository: [Todo App Repository](https://github.com/scythemenace/todo_app).

### Week 6

**Topics Covered:**

- React Hooks
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`
  - `useContext`
  - `useReducer`

**Description:**

Focused on understanding React Hooks and how they simplify state management and side effects in functional components. Created examples and experiments to solidify these concepts.

### Week 7

**Topics Covered:**

- Recoil for State Management
- Prop Drilling Issues

**Description:**

Learned how to use Recoil for efficient state management in React applications. Addressed the issues of prop drilling and how Recoil can simplify state sharing across components in large projects.

### Week 8

**Topics Covered:**

- Tailwind CSS
- Axios for HTTP Requests

**Description:**

Explored Tailwind CSS as a modern framework for writing responsive and utility-first CSS. Also learned about Axios for making better HTTP requests in React applications.

## Future Plans

I will continue to update this repository as I progress in learning more advanced topics in the MERN stack, including but not limited to:

- Advanced React patterns
- Redux and other state management libraries
- Testing with Jest and Enzyme
- Deployment strategies
- TypeScript integration
